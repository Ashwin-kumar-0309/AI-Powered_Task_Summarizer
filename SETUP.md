# 🚀 Quick Setup Guide

## Smart Task Summarizer + Tagger is Ready!

Your AI-powered task processing application is now set up and running. Here's what you need to do to get started:

## ✅ Current Status
- ✅ Next.js 15 application created
- ✅ TypeScript configured  
- ✅ Tailwind CSS styling ready
- ✅ OpenAI integration set up
- ✅ All components created
- ✅ Sample data included
- ✅ Development server running at http://localhost:3000

## 🔑 Next Steps

### 1. Add Your OpenAI API Key
The application needs an OpenAI API key to process tasks with GPT-4:

1. Copy the environment template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

2. Get your API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

3. Add it to `.env.local`:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

### 2. Test the Application
1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. Click "Load All Samples" to add example tasks
3. Click "Process with AI" (will show error until API key is added)
4. Once API key is added, try processing the sample tasks!

## 🎯 Features to Test

### Sample Tasks
